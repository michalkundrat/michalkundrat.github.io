Hello, <br>
I am Michal KundrÃ¡t, 17 year old sixth form student from Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°, living in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. <br>
I am currently doing my A-Level qualifications at school, studying Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science, in the hope of achieving grades which open doors to an undecided path. <br>
In order to fulfil my ambitions, I know that I must work hard. This website will become a log of my works and things that I wish to share with others, such as projects that I create in my spare time - I look forward to sharing more soon!
